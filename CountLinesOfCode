There is a package called metrics that is in Volume 20 of the
comp.sources.unix archive that contains a program called kdsi; it's a
decent loc counter, if you don't want to bother to write one yourself.
In fact, here is the man page for it:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KDSI(L COSI)      Misc. Reference Manual Pages       KDSI(L COSI)
 
NAME
     kdsi - count number of lines of code in a C program
 
SYNOPSIS
     kdsi [ file ]*
 
DESCRIPTION
     Kdsi counts the lines of code in a C program.   It  provides
     the following information:
 
               lines of code
               blank lines
               comments lines
               number of comments
 
     If you specify no files, kdsi will read from stdin.  If  you
     specify  more  than  one file on the command line, kdsi will
     print the total for each category.
 
SEE ALSO
     wc(1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The metrics package also has stuff for McCabe & Halstead metrics. You can
probably find it in lots of places, but I know you can get it from
gatekeeper.dec.com in the directory:
   pub/usenet/comp.sources.unix/volume20/metrics 

There are 14 parts to the package.
