The aquarium image was rendered with rayshade from a script written by
kilian@cray.com and Jerome A. Farm.

These images are useful for testing the `display' program from
contrib/ImageMagick.tar.gz on ftp.x.org.  `display' is a program that
can display an image on any X server:

  make
  display *.miff
