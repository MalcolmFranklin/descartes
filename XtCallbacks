For what it's worth:

This is not true.

   : Actually the function does not have to have "extern C" linkage.  It just
   : can't be a non-static member function.

This is true.

Based on my experience with several large C++/Motif programs that have been
ported to many platforms and C++ compilers.

But does anything say that it won't?  C and C++ use the same calling
convention for plain functions, so C linkage v. C++ should have no effect
on function pointers.
