  #####   THE  BEGINNING   #####


The name of the Descartes specification is [a.des].
The name of the log file is [a.log].

The contents of input file is shown below:
12


Module Title TWO_OF_(A)
$reference direct product - A
__(aDP_first) Direct Product A
 >> Go to Node x
$match direct product - x
__(aDP_first) Direct Product x
 >> Go to Node '1'
$literal - '1'
__(AL_first) Literal '1'
 => Successful matching at node '1' with input string
 -> Forward input buffer pointer to location 1
 << Back to Node x
$match direct product - x
__(aDP_succeed) Direct Product x
__(aDP_succeed) Direct Product x
 << Succeed; Back to Node A
$reference direct product - A
__(aDP_succeed) Direct Product A
__(aDP_succeed) Direct Product A
 >> Succeed; Go to Node y
$match direct product - y
__(aDP_first) Direct Product y
 >> Go to Node '2'
$literal - '2'
__(AL_first) Literal '2'
 => Successful matching at node '2' with input string
 -> Forward input buffer pointer to location 2
 << Back to Node y
$match direct product - y
__(aDP_succeed) Direct Product y
__(aDP_succeed) Direct Product y
 << Succeed; Back to Node A
$reference direct product - A
