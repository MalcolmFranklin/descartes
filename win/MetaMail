SharedPrint is an HP product, and only runs on their computers, as far
as I know.  It shouldn't have any trouble driving a fully compatible
PCL-3 or PCL-4 device.

As I mentioned, I'm using it to support printing for about 30 hosts,
which include macintosh, DOS, and unix machines.

You can contact any HP sale-thing, who should be able to find it.  I
bought it as part of the 'MPower' multimedia package from HP.
