in a given release.

revision 1.14
date: 1994/07/02 21:00:29;  author: franklin;  state: Exp;  lines: +5 -5
1.Flush output sent to the Log file to simplify debugging.
2. Delete unused global Line_No.
3. Reset yylineno to 1 before reading another Descartes specification.
4. Improved wording of some diagnostic messages.
5. Define Max_Value_of in desc_struct.c, make it an extern declaration
   in desc_struct.h (it used to be defined in desc_struct.h).
6. Add extern qualifier to the declarations of the following globals in
   desc_struct.h:
     DESC_File_Stat  Error_Counter  return_flag  concurrent  Hoare_Root_Dummy
     Temp_Node  Current_Node  Prev_Node  pre_root  F_Hoare_Root_Dummy
     Root_Stack  Temp_Stack  Current_Stack  Prev_Stack
7. Set Output_File, S_Output_File, and/or W_Output_File to stdout if they
   cannot be opened.
8. Add italic font to the default fontlist (small_italic).
9. When the user selects "Help->Product Information" from the main menu,
   display Franz Hals picture of Rene Descartes, and the names of all
   researchers who had inputs to the language definition and/or language
   processor implementation.
----------------------------
revision 1.13
date: 1994/06/15 21:12:05;  author: franklin;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -4
1. The command line now works.  The language processor will execute the spec
   immediately if the user passes "-batch True" on the command line, and will
   exit immediately after executing the spec if the user passes both
   "-batch True -iconic True" on the command line.
2. Removed several globals that either were never used, or that impeded
   usability of the language processor:
      Build_Flag_4_New_File  Build_Flag_4_Old_File  File_Modified
      Current_Dir  Path_Name  Cmd_String
3. Clears the drawing area whenever it reads a new input spec.
4. Updates main window titlebar whenever it reads a new input spec (appends
   the base filenaem to the titlebar text).
5. Moved definitions of variables once defined in desc_strurct.h to
   desc_struct.c; you really shouldnt allocate storage for variables in an
   include file.
6. Added a check for a NULL pointer being passed to Free_Hoare_Tree().
----------------------------
revision 1.12
date: 1994/06/14 21:31:42;  author: franklin;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -4
1. Moved the pushbuttons and slider bar from the parent widget of the
   drawing area, to a toolbar in the application mainwindow widget.
2. The selections under "File->Open..." all work now.
3. "Options->Default X Resource Values" works now.
----------------------------
revision 1.11
date: 1994/06/12 04:58:02;  author: franklin;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -3
Moved the execution animation window from wid1.c to main.c.
----------------------------
revision 1.10
date: 1994/06/12 04:51:42;  author: franklin;  state: Exp;  lines: +5 -5
Moved the execution animation window from wid1.c to main.c.
----------------------------
revision 1.9
date: 1994/06/09 01:55:27;  author: franklin;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -4
1. Moved all user interface initialization functionality from wid1.c to
   main.c -- EXCEPT for the execution animation window.
2. Use variables named msgid when referencing queue MSKKEY, and msgid1 when
   referencing MSGKEY1.
3. Build_Proc() is no longer a callback function; update it parameter list.
4. Send all message text to a single text widget.
5. Workaround non-ANSI/ISO-compliance of offsetof() macro in stddef.h for
   SunOS 4.
6. Dont escape newline characters in order to form long string constants;
   use string concatenation feature of ANSI/ISO C instead.
----------------------------
revision 1.8
date: 1994/06/02 17:41:28;  author: franklin;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -4
1. Remove alert_dcl.h from the build.
2. Enable stricter type checking when passing the -Xa switch to the
   CenterLine compiler.
3. Remove several references to memory which had already been free()d.
4. Remove globals that are no longer used.
5. Add command_line.c to implement custom application resources/command-
   line switches.
6. Replace the non-POSIX ftime() function with POSIX time() where possible.
7. Added growbuf utilities for storing/appending strings of arbitrary
   length.
8. Use the default foreground/background colors/pixmaps.  Let the user
   alter the defaults with X resources.
9.Set the text on the dialog box that pops up when you press the "Quit"
  button.
----------------------------
revision 1.7
date: 1994/05/17 02:58:25;  author: franklin;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -3
Dont try to build the HP executable on a Sun!
----------------------------
revision 1.6
date: 1994/05/17 01:15:43;  author: franklin;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -3
Release both HP and Sun executables.
----------------------------
revision 1.5
date: 1994/05/17 01:08:19;  author: franklin;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -4
Ported to HP-UX 9.01 C compiler, as well as SunOS 4.1.3 CenterLine clcc
compiler.
Replaced SysV semaphores with a semaphore module implemented with POSIX.1
compliant advisory locks.
Capable of using either Bison or YACC to generate the Descartes language
parser.
Works with CDE 1.1B
Can now run on an X terminal with less than 16 megabytes of RAM.
----------------------------
revision 1.4
date: 1994/05/02 16:01:51;  author: franklin;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -3
Builds with CenterLines clcc compiler.  Build_Hoare_Tree() is declared
to have 4 required parameters and two optional parameters.
sem.c has been split into semops.h and semops.c.  No source code file
#includes sem.c anymore.  Used ANSI/ISO <stdarg.h> instead of <vararg.h>.
Started using the POSIX <unistd.h> instead of <sys/types.h>, <sys/stat.h>
and <sys/file.h>.
----------------------------
revision 1.3
date: 1994/04/12 13:08:59;  author: franklin;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -4
Converted all code to ANSI/ISO Standard C.
Removed most Purify warnings.
----------------------------
revision 1.2
date: 1994/04/08 09:20:38;  author: franklin;  state: Exp;  lines: +6 -4
Build on a node with X/Motif libraries installed.
