1.What is Windows NT?
  Windows NT is a new operating system written by
  Microsoft.  Its primary user interface is identical to
  that of Windows 3.1 but it has no common code and does
  not require MS-DOS.  It provides a much richer system
  than Windows and provides program access to all
  features via the Win32 API.  It is also capable of
  running (some) programs written for Windows 3.1, MS-
  DOS, OS/2 and POSIX.
2.Hardware
  2.1.   Requirements
  The recommended minimum configuration is 12MB RAM,
  100MB disc, a 386 processor and a VGA screen.
  2.2.   Availability
  Windows NT is currently available on machines using
  INTEL x86, RISC (MIPS) and DEC Alpha processors.  It
  has been announced for the PowerPC architecture.
  2.3.   Compatibility List
  Microsoft publishes a list of hardware which is
  compatible with Windows NT.  For hardware not in this
  list, contact your supplier.  The list is available
  over the network from ftp.microsoft.com in directory
  Advsys/winnt/docs/hcl.
3.Relation to Windows
  Although none of the operating system code comes from
  Windows, a lot of the on-line help and applications
  does.
4.Capabilities
  Windows NT has a micro-kernel or virtual operating
  system architecture (like Mach or Chorus).  This means
  that there is a minimal underlying operating system
  above which run various subsystems which control a
  process' run-time environment.
  Windows NT supports virtual memory, pre-emptive multi-
  tasking, international language standards, networking,
  multiple installable file systems, multiple users,
  multiple processors and a 32-bit flat memory model.  It
  can also emulate a Windows 3.1 environment and a bare
  MSDOS environment.
  4.1.   NTFS
  NTFS is a new filing system.  It supports full
  discretionary access control (DAC) [this means file
  permissions] via Access Control Lists (ACL) and is
  transaction based which gives good recovery from
  catastrophic events such as power failure.  It also
  supports FAT compatibility (FAT is the MSDOS filing
  system).  Maximum file size is 2 exp 64 bytes.
  4.2.   Security
  Windows NT has been designed to fulfil the B2 level
  requirements of the Orange Book (DoD ???) and is
  undergoing the process of certification to C2 level.
  DAC requires use of  NTFS.
  Passwords are never sent in clear over a network.
  4.3.   Advanced Server
  Windows NT Advanced Server provides the following extra
  functionality (compared to the Workstation product).
  Fault tolerance (Raid levels 0, 1 & 5).
  Domains and centralised administration.
  Services for Macs.
  64 RAS slots instead of just 1.
5.Compatibility
  5.1.   Windows
  Programs written to the Win16 API will run on Windows
  NT without change.  Translation to the win32 API occurs
  at run-time.  All such programs are run in one virtual
  machine giving the same environment as under windows.
  This means that any badly behaved programs will still
  cause trouble though they should not bring down the
  system (but may cause the WOW session to crash).
  5.1.1. Windows for Workgroups
  5.2.   MS-DOS
  Windows NT can run MS-DOS programs as long as they do
  not access hardware directly.  Calls to BIOS and direct
  writing to the COM ports are supported.  It also
  supports the FAT filing system and can allow programs
  to access NTFS disc partitions by providing FAT-
  compatible names for files.
  5.3.   OS/2
  Windows NT can run programs written for OS/2 but only
  character mode I/O is supported.  It also supports HPFS
  (the native OS/2 filing system).
  5.4.   POSIX/UNIX
  5.4.1. The POSIX Environment
  The POSIX environment subsystem conforms exactly to the
  IEEE 1003.1 specification.  This means that no other
  functions, such as graphics, networking, shared memory
  or message-passing are supported although the
  underlying operating system provides these facilities.
  For this reason, developers are more likely to use the
  UNIX emulation packages that are available.
  The Resource Kit contains 20 Unix commands and a POSIX
  shell.
  5.4.2. Lpr/lpd printing
  A public domain package, NTlpr, available from
  ftp.cica.indiana.edu allows use of an lpr command.
  This has no interaction with the Windows NT print
  system.  There is also an lpd for Windows which works
  from the same site.
  5.4.3. Emulation packages
  Hippix and Nutcracker both provide a library (DLL)
  which provides support for most of the UNIX system
  calls and some common UNIX utilities.  Nutcracker also
  supports all the standard Unix library functions.
  Unite (Consensys) provides more than 100 Unix commands.
  5.5.   X Windows
  Windows NT does not provide a facility like X Windows
  where computation and display may be on separate
  machines although it does have an RPC facility which
  could be used to provide this.  Several third-party
  products are available which provide support for X.
  eXcursion (DEC) -   X server
  eXceed (Hummingbird) - X server and development kit
  inc. MOTIF
  NtNix (Congruent) - X client support
  Metro-X (Metro), MultiView/X (JSB), PC-Xware (NCD) see
  the Win32 catalog.
6.Graphics
  6.1.   Fonts
  Windows NT (like Windows 3.1) supports True-type fonts
  which do not distort when a new point size is selected.
7.Sound
  Refer to the hardware compatibility list.
8.Networking
  Windows NT contains substantial built-in networking.
  8.1.   Networked Information
  EMWAC will be porting full-function versions of Gopher,
  WWW and WAIS servers; available 2Q94 or perhaps before
  and freely available.  Windows clients for all these
  are available and work under Windows NT.
  8.1.1. FTP Sites
  ftp.microsoft.com, ftp.cica.indiana.edu.
  emwac.ed.ac.uk mirrors these and also contains a news
  archive.
  8.1.2. Gopher
  No known sites yet.
  8.1.3. WWW
  No known sites yet.
  8.1.4. Wais
  No known sites yet.
  8.1.5. Support
     8.1.5.1.    Compuserve
  See the Windows FAQ.
     8.1.5.2.    Others?
  8.2.   Mail
  MS mail and Schedule+ come as an integral part of
  Windows NT.
  8.2.1. MS Mail
  8.2.2. SMTP
  Connecting MS mail to SMTP systems requires use of a
  gateway running on a dedicated PC.
  8.2.3. X400
  MS are developing the Enterprise Messaging System which
  is an X400(88) product.
  8.3.   News
  The primary Usenet newsgroups concerned with Windows NT
  are comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup and comp.os.ms-
  windows.nt.misc.  There are a number of groups which
  concern Windows only.  For programming to the Win32 API
  use comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32.
  The native Windows NT newsreader is Trumpet (from ??).
  8.4.   Lan Manager
  Windows NT provides full support for Lan Manager 2.2.
  Lan Manager client for Windows 3.1 is freely available.
  8.5.   Novell Netware
  Redirectors (requestors) from Novell and Microsoft are
  in beta.
  The Microsoft version can be ftp'd from
  ftp.microsoft.com:Advsys\winnt\Sup-ed\nwcs or
  emwac.ed.ac.uk:gowinnt\Advsys\winnt/sup-ed/nwcs.
  8.6.   TCP/IP
  TCP/IP is part of the Windows NT system.  It includes
  ftp and telnet clients but not servers.
  Software Innovations will be shipping a fulll TCP/IP
  connectivity kit in 1Q94 including  telnetd, rlogin/rsh
  etc., full lpr/lpd, NNTP server and news reader, SLIP &
  PPP, and a gateway for MS mail to X400 and SMTP.
  8.6.1. NFS
  Products from Sun and Beame and Whiteside are currently
  in beta.  A PD version (SOSSNT) is
  available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu.  There is also a
  product from FTP in beta and Chameleon 3.2 (Netmanage).
  8.6.2  SNMP.
  Windows NT provides an SNMP responder.  The Resource Kit
  CD contains SNMP query software.
  8.7.   X25
  Currently, support for X25 only applies to RAS.
  8.8.   SNA
  Client uses built-in DLC; server is add-on.
  8.9.   Fax
  No native products currently available.  There is a fax
  gateway which requires a dedicated PC.
9.Applications
  9.1.   Windows Applications
  See the Windows FAQ
  9.2.   Native Applications
  A list of Win32 applications is available as an Excel
  spreadsheet, general\WIN32NOV.XLS, from emwac.ed.ac.uk
  (and others?).
10.    Current Known Problems
  10.1.  Applications.
  10.1.1.Ami Pro - right justification
  This may leave the right margin ragged and the cursor
  position inaccurate.  Workaround is to select 'View
  preferences' and turn off  'Display as Printed'.
11.    Tips, Tricks and Secrets.
12.    Future Windows systems
  12.1.  Chicago
  This product will be a complete rewrite of the Windows
  system but will not be based on Windows NT.  It may not
  provide a separately installable MS-DOS.  It will
  support the Win32 API.  It should be on general release
  about 1Q95.
  12.2.  Cairo
  This will be a subsequent version of Windows NT which
  is fully object-oriented.  Its release date is expected
  to be in 95.
